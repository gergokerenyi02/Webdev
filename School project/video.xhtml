  <h1>Description of the video</h1>
  <p>In the video there are 2 tennis bracelets on a white flanel, with round cut stones. Each stone is held by 4 prong. The video moves from the righ to the left and shows the bracelets. How the bracelet shines is in the focus, this is the main point of the video. The video has a background music. The right-left movement of the video keeps repeating itself for 3 times. The camera fades to the starting point. At the end it fades to a title, which writes Larsen Jewellery, which is a partner of TENNESSI jewelry.</p>
